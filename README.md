## Lab Assignments

There were 5 lab assignments in total, each one consisting of a set of problems. These problems had to be solved using the following simulators.

- [Î¼Lab](http://mycourses.ntua.gr/document/goto/?url=%2F8085.zip&cidReq=ECE1175) - Simulator for the 8085 microprocessor
- [Atmel AVR Studio 7](http://www.atmel.com/tools/ATMELSTUDIO.aspx) - Simulator for AVR microcontrollers
- [EasyAVR6 + Flash programmer](https://www.mikroe.com/easyavr) - Drivers for the EasyAVR6 development board

The access to the development board with the ATmega16 AVR Microcontroller was granted remotely, with the use of [X2Go](https://wiki.x2go.org/doku.php).

The topics covered by each assignment follow.

## Practice Problems

There is a folder with practice problems, that were solved while practicing for the exams. The naming convention is `YYx-identifier` where:
- `YY` is the year of the exam
- `x` is the exam type (a for the regural one and b for the retake one)
- `identifier` is the identifier of the file (answers or questions)
